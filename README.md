City of New Carrollton: Green Team Website Redesign
> Farhan Ahmed, Jonathan Land, Nicholas Underwood

The goal of our project was to redesign the City of New Carrolltonâ€™s Green Team website. The redesign was meant to address issues with the current Green Team website. Some of these issues include outdated information, too much text, and a lack of ability to engage with the Green Team. To address these issues, we updated the website content, added more images and links, and provided the ability for users to take a survey and provide their email to learn about Green Team events. We came up with these ideas after doing research on other cities Green Team and sustainability websites.
